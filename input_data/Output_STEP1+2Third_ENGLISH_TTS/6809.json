Along with electric Hummer and Cadillac models, the company is readying three other GMC models using the Ultium system, including an electric pickup, and four Chevrolet brand EVs, including a pickup and small crossover.

Separately, Barra declined to comment on GMs potential partnership with hydrogen truckmaker Nikola Inc. With regard to other partnerships, we dont have anything specific to announce, she told Barclays equity analyst Brian Johnson. GM says it will be able to sell electric vehicles with range of up to 400 miles per charge at a profit, owing to costs for its Ultium batteries that are about 40% below those currently used in its Bolt EV. A next-generation Ultium that arrives in a few years will be 60% cheaper than Bolt batteries and may offer a range of up to 450 miles per charge, said Doug Parks, GMs executive vice president for product development, purchasing and supply chain. Additional cost savings will come from commonizing more parts across all of GMs product lines.
